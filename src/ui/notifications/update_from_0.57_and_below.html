        ⚠️ Sorry to interrupt. Important Update Notification from your Temporary Containers Add-on.

      <div class="content">
        We had to change a preference/option that was default before: If you open New Tabs, those
        tabs will now automatically get reopened in Temporary Containers.<br>
        <br>
        If you want the old behavior of reopening Websites on first navigation back, you can change
        it in the <a href="../options.html" target="_blank">preferences/options</a> under
        "Advanced -> Automatic Mode" (at the bottom). Make sure to read the attached warning
        which is the reason for this change and this notification.<br>
        <br>
        Thanks for your attention.
