- Open a new tab and navigate to "about:debugging"
- Tick the "Enable debugging" checkbox (untick again when you're done posting the Issue)
- Scroll down to Temporary Containers and click the "Debug" link
- Confirm the dialog with OK, you now see "Developer Tools" with "Console" selected
- Type into the console "log.DEBUG=true" (without the quotes), it should respond with "true" (type "log.DEBUG=false" into the console when you're done posting the Issue)
- Now reproduce your issue
- Switch back to the "Developer Tools", select everything in the console
- Copy everything in the console, paste it into a .txt file, save the file, and attach it to the issue by drag&drop'ing it into the text-box -->
