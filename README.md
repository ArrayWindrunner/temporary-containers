# Temporary Containers

**Early Alpha Version.**

Automatically open Tabs in new Temporary Containers when:
* Pressing the Ctrl+T Shortcut
* Clicking the "New Tab" Symbol (+)
* Clicking "New Tab" in the Browser Menu
* MiddleMouse Click on a Link on a Website
* Ctrl+LeftMouseClick on a Link on a Website

Doesn't open Tabs in new Temporary Containers when:
* Regular click on a Link on a Website
* Website redirects or opens new Tab itself
* Clicking "New Tab" in the RightClick ContextMenu on a Link on a Website
* Pressing Shift+LeftMouseClick on a Link on a Website

## Notes

There's a discussion about [Moving between containers](https://github.com/mozilla/multi-account-containers/wiki/Moving-between-containers) and I think
that this Extension does a moderate Job to enhance privacy by providing Temporary/Throwaway Containers whenever possible while don't breaking
navigation (or e.g. OAuth redirects) on a given Website as long as the user just LeftMouse clicks.

Works together with [Multi-Account Containers](https://github.com/mozilla/multi-account-containers).
